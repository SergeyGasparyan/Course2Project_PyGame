This is a simple yet challenging game that tests your memory and observation skills. The goal is to memorize the sequence of appearing circles and correctly recall the numbers they represent.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `main.py` file using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
cd src/
python main.py
```

3. Upon execution, you will be prompted to enter the number of circles you want to start the game with.
4. Watch closely as the white circles with "?" marks appear on the screen, and try to memorize their sequence and the numbers they represent.
5. Once you think you have memorized the sequence, click on the circles with "?" marks to reveal their numbers. 
6. If you are confident that all the numbers are correct, press the "Enter" key.
7. If you guessed correctly, a message will pop up congratulating you on winning, and you will advance to the next level with one additional ball added to the sequence.
8. If you made a mistake, you will be asked whether you want to play again or quit the game.
9. If you click on a ball twice, its number will change back to "?" again, and you can assign the number to another circle.
